# 🧩 Singleton Pattern Example – Logger Utility

A Java implementation of the **Singleton Design Pattern** using a `Logger` utility class to ensure that only one instance of the logger exists throughout the application lifecycle. This pattern is crucial for ensuring consistency, especially in applications that rely on shared resources such as configuration or logging systems.

## 📌 Problem Statement
As part of a Cognizant assignment, this project addresses the challenge of implementing a thread-safe Singleton Logger to:
- Prevent multiple instances of the logger
- Ensure centralized logging
- Demonstrate proficiency with core object-oriented design principles

---

## 🔧 Features
- ✅ Singleton Design Pattern implementation in Java
- ✅ Thread-safe with double-checked locking
- ✅ Timestamped log messages
- ✅ Demonstrates shared instance usage
- ✅ Clean and extensible codebase

---

## 🧠 Why Singleton?
Singleton ensures:
- **Single instance** throughout the application's lifetime
- **Global point of access**
- **Controlled access to shared resources** (like logging, caching, etc.)



## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- Java 17+
- IDE: VS Code


## How to Run
- javac Logger.java Main.java
- java Main

✨ Acknowledgements
Special thanks to Cognizant for the opportunity to demonstrate design pattern proficiency through this exercise.
