**Difference between JPA, Hibernate, and Spring Data JPA**
---
What is JPA?
* It‚Äôs a specification defined by JSR 338.
* It provides standard annotations and interfaces to map Java objects to relational databases.
* Think of JPA as a set of rules or contracts that any ORM tool (like Hibernate) can implement.

‚úÖ Key Points:
* JPA itself has no implementation.
* It defines things like @Entity, @Id, @Table, EntityManager, etc.
* It lets Java applications interact with databases without writing SQL directly.

```
Example of JPA in action:
You annotate your class with @Entity, and JPA handles the mapping logic ‚Äî but you still need an implementation to actually run it. That‚Äôs where Hibernate comes in.
```
---
What is Hibernate?
* Hibernate is an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) tool.
* It is the most popular implementation of the JPA specification.
* It provides the actual working code for the contracts defined by JPA.

‚úÖ Key Points:
* Hibernate implements JPA interfaces and annotations.
* It can also work in native Hibernate mode (i.e., not using JPA).
* Hibernate manages:
* SQL generation
* Database connection pooling
* Caching
* Lazy/Eager loading
* Transaction management (via JTA or JDBC)
```
Simply put:
JPA says what should be done.
Hibernate actually does it.
```
---
What is Spring Data JPA?
* It‚Äôs a part of the Spring Data family.
* It provides an abstraction layer over JPA implementations like Hibernate.
* Its main job is to reduce boilerplate code when interacting with the database.

‚úÖ Key Features:
* You don‚Äôt have to write implementation code for basic queries.
* Just create a Repository interface and extend JpaRepository ‚Äî Spring will generate the implementation at runtime.
* Supports custom query methods, pagination, sorting, and transaction management automatically.
* Works with any JPA provider ‚Äî Hibernate is just the default.
```
PA = Specification (what to do)
Hibernate = Implementation (how to do it)
Spring Data JPA = Abstraction (makes it easy to do)
```

üÜö Hibernate vs Spring Data JPA
---
üîπ Overview
This section demonstrates the difference between using Hibernate directly vs using Spring Data JPA in a Spring Boot project for saving an Employee entity into a database.

---

üî∏ Hibernate
---
Hibernate is an Object Relational Mapping (ORM) framework that implements the JPA specification. Using Hibernate directly gives fine-grained control but requires writing more boilerplate code.
Code Example
```
public Integer addEmployee(Employee employee){
    Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
    Transaction tx = null;
    Integer employeeID = null;

    try {
        tx = session.beginTransaction();
        employeeID = (Integer) session.save(employee);
        tx.commit();
    } catch (HibernateException e) {
        if (tx != null) tx.rollback();
        e.printStackTrace();
    } finally {
        session.close();
    }
    return employeeID;
}
```
Explanation
* Session is explicitly opened and closed.
* Transaction is manually managed.
* Boilerplate error handling and rollback logic is required.
* You are responsible for lifecycle management of the persistence context.
---

üî∏ Spring Data JPA
---
Spring Data JPA builds on top of JPA and Hibernate. It provides repository abstractions that reduce the amount of code needed for CRUD operations.
Code Example

EmployeeRepository.java
```
public interface EmployeeRepository extends JpaRepository<Employee, Integer> {
}
```

EmployeeService.java
```
@Autowired
private EmployeeRepository employeeRepository;

@Transactional
public void addEmployee(Employee employee) {
    employeeRepository.save(employee);
}
```
Explanation
* No need to create or manage sessions or transactions manually.
* JpaRepository provides built-in CRUD operations.
* Spring manages the persistence context and transactions behind the scenes.
* Cleaner, more testable, and maintainable.
