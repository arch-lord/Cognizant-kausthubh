ORM Learn â€“ Spring Boot + JPA + MySQL
---
```
This project demonstrates the use of Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and MySQL for performing basic ORM (Object Relational Mapping) operations. It is designed to help understand how entities, repositories, and services work together in a Spring application.
```
1. Project Overview
* A Java-based ORM learning application
* Uses Spring Boot with Spring Data JPA and Hibernate
* Connects to a MySQL database to perform CRUD operations on a simple country table

2. Project Structure
* model: Contains the Country entity class mapped to the database table
* repository: Contains the CountryRepository interface extending JPA repository
* service: Contains the business logic using CountryService
* OrmLearnApplication: The main class that boots the app and tests data fetching

3. Database Setup
* MySQL database named ormlearn is used
* A table named country is created with two columns: co_code and co_name
* Sample records like "India" and "United States of America" are inserted

4. Configuration
* The application uses the following configurations:
* Logging levels for Spring and Hibernate
* Database connection properties (URL, username, password)
* Hibernate dialect and schema validation
* Log pattern setup for detailed debugging

5. Building the Project
* The project is built using Maven
* A specific Maven command is used to handle corporate proxy settings (if required)

6. Running the Application
* The main method in OrmLearnApplication is executed
* Spring Boot starts the application context
* The application fetches all countries using the service layer and logs the results

7. Class Responsibilities
* Country: Entity class with annotations to map it to the country table
* CountryRepository: Repository interface to access the database
* CountryService: Service class that calls repository methods and is marked transactional
* OrmLearnApplication: Entry point that triggers the data fetch operation

8. Sample Output
* On successful execution, logs will show:
* Start and End of test
* SQL query generated by Hibernate
* List of countries retrieved from the database

9. Next Steps / Enhancements
* Add more CRUD methods (insert, update, delete)
* Add RESTful endpoints using a controller class
* Connect the backend with a frontend app for UI interaction
