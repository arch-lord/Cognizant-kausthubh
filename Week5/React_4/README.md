# 📘 React Component Lifecycle

## 🔍 **Why Component Lifecycle is Needed**

React components go through a lifecycle from creation to destruction. Understanding this lifecycle allows developers to:

* 🔄 **Control rendering and updates:** Efficiently manage what and when parts of the UI re-render.
* ⚙️ **Handle side-effects:** Perform operations like data fetching, subscriptions, or DOM manipulation at the right time.
* 🧹 **Manage cleanup:** Prevent memory leaks by cleaning up timers, listeners, or subscriptions.
* 🚀 **Improve performance:** Use hooks to optimize rendering and resource usage.
* 🔧 **Debug effectively:** Trace issues in the lifecycle to fix unexpected behaviors.

## 🌱 **Lifecycle Hook Methods**

React (especially in class components) offers various lifecycle methods to hook into different stages of a component's life:

### 📦 **Mounting (when component is being created and inserted into the DOM):**

* `constructor()`
* `static getDerivedStateFromProps()`
* `render()`
* `componentDidMount()`

### 🔄 **Updating (when props or state changes):**

* `static getDerivedStateFromProps()`
* `shouldComponentUpdate()`
* `render()`
* `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()`
* `componentDidUpdate()`

### 🧹 **Unmounting (when component is removed from the DOM):**

* `componentWillUnmount()`

### ⚠️ **Error Handling (for catching errors during rendering):**

* `componentDidCatch()`
* `static getDerivedStateFromError()`

> ⚠️ Note: In **functional components**, lifecycle behaviors are handled using **React Hooks** like `useEffect`, `useState`, etc.

## 📋 **Sequence of Steps in Rendering a Component**

### ✅ **Mounting Phase**

1. `constructor()` – Initialize state and bind methods
2. `getDerivedStateFromProps()` – Sync state with props (optional)
3. `render()` – Return JSX to render UI
4. `componentDidMount()` – Perform side effects like API calls

### 🔄 **Updating Phase**

1. `getDerivedStateFromProps()` – Again checks for prop/state sync
2. `shouldComponentUpdate()` – Decide whether re-render is needed
3. `render()` – Re-renders UI
4. `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()` – Capture info before update (e.g., scroll position)
5. `componentDidUpdate()` – Perform operations after the update

### ❌ **Unmounting Phase**

1. `componentWillUnmount()` – Clean up (remove listeners, cancel requests, etc.)
